Kaizen House is a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) for a Japanese restaurant. It showcases the restaurant's menu, ambiance, and allows customers to place orders online. The project demonstrates advanced web development techniques and modern JavaScript practices.

## 💻 Technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Webpack
* npm

## ✨ Features
* **Single Page Application**: Seamless navigation without page reloads
* **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Menu items, testimonials, and about section dynamically loaded
* **Interactive Menu**: Users can browse menu items by category
* **Shopping Cart**: Fully functional cart with add, remove, and quantity adjustment features
* **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes and devices

## 🛠️ Development Process
1. **Project Setup**: Initialized with Webpack for module bundling and asset management
2. **Component-Based Architecture**: Developed reusable components (Header, Footer, MenuItem)
3. **Routing**: Implemented custom routing solution for SPA functionality
4. **State Management**: Created a cart system with local state management
5. **Styling**: Utilized CSS modules for component-specific styling
6. **Optimization**: Implemented lazy loading for images and animations
